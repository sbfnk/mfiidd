# Model fitting and inference for infectious disease dynamics

This repository contains the material to create the mfiidd webpage with the practicals.

All the raw material is in the folder `Rmd/` and is written in `Rmarkdown`. Any
changes to the Rmarkdown files are automatically updated on the web site once
committed to the `main` branch.

## Local testing

The `html` pages can be generated locally using the function 

```{r}
rmarkdown::render_site("Rmd/")
```

This creates the `html` pages in the `Rmd/_site` directory.
