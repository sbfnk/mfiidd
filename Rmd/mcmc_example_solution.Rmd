title: "Full example: The Metropolis-Hastings sampler"
---

Here is a possible solution for the Metropolis-Hastings sampler.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("scripts", "snippets", "our-mcmcMh.r"))
```

```{r our_mcmcMh}
```

You can copy and paste the function into your **R** session, and proceed from there.

[Return](mcmc.html#the-metropolis-hastings-sampler) to the MCMC session.
