title: "Partial example: The particle filter"

Below, you can find an example of how to code a particle filter. Some bits are left out for you to fill in (marked "INSERT HERE"). Each "INSERT HERE" statement requires one line of code. If you struggle, you can find a link to a solution below the function.

```{r smc-guided-example, eval=FALSE}
# This is a function that takes four parameters:
# - fitmodel: a fitmodel object
# - theta: named numeric vector. Values of the parameters for which the marginal log-likelihood is desired.
# - initState: named numeric vector. Initial values of the state variables.
# - data: data frame. Observation times and observed data.
# The function returns the value of the marginal log-likelihood
my_particleFilter <- function(fitmodel, theta, initState, data, nParticles) {
  ## Initialisation of the algorithm

  # Marginal log-likelihood is set to 0 and will be updated during the filtering steps
  margLogLike <- 0

  # Particle states can be stored in a list
  stateParticles <- # INSERT HERE

  # Weight: initially equal for all the particles
  # particle weight can be stored in a vector
  weightParticles <- # INSERT HERE

  # Initialise time variable
  currentTime <- 0

  ## Loop over observation times: resample, propagate, weight
  for (i in seq_len(nrow(data))) {
    # Extract next data point (must be a vector)
    dataPoint <- # INSERT HERE
    nextTime <- dataPoint["time"]

    # Resample particles according to their weights.
    # You can use the `sample` function of R (normalization of the weights is done in the function)
    indexResampled <- # INSERT HERE
    stateParticles <- stateParticles[indexResampled]

    ## Loop over particles: propagate and weight
    for (p in 1:nParticles) {
      # Extract current state of the particle
      currentStateParticle <- stateParticles[[p]]

      # Propagate the particle from current observation time
      # to the next one using the function `fitmodel$simulate`
      traj <- # INSERT HERE

      # Extract state of the model at next observation time.
      # Make sure that modelPoint is a vector
      modelPoint <- # INSERT HERE

      # Weight the particle with the likelihood of the observed
      # data point using the function `fitmodel$dPointObs`
      weightParticles[p] <- # INSERT HERE

      # Update state of the p particle
      stateParticles[[p]] <- modelPoint
    }

    # Increment time
    currentTime <- nextTime

    ## Increment the marginal log-likelihood
    # Add the log of the mean of the particles weights
    margLogLike <- margLogLike + # INSERT HERE
  }

  ## Return marginal log-likelihood
  return(margLogLike)
}
```
