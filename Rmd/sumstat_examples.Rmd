Here is a (by no means exhaustive) list of examples for summary statistics.

**Technical note**: we added put `na.rm = T` to all the summary statistics. This tells the function to ignore data points that have a non-existing value. Normally, this shouldn't happen, but unfortunately the deterministic ODE integrators in the `deSolve` package can run into numerical instabilities when a trajectory stays around 0 for too long and produce very small negative states. Normally this is not a problem, but it will be if we try to take a sample from the Poisson distribution.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("scripts", "snippets", "sumstat-examples.r"))
```

```{r sumstat_examples}
```

Copy and paste any of these you would like to test.
