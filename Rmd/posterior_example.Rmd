title: "Partial example: posterior"
---

Below, you can find an example of how to code the posterior. Some bits are left out for you to fill in (marked "INSERT HERE"). Each "INSERT HERE" statement requires one line of code. If you struggle, you can find a link to the solution below the function.

```{r eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
# This is a function that takes 4 arguments:
# - fitmodel, a fitmodel object that defines the model dynamics,
#   prior and likelihoods.
# - theta, a named vector of parameters
# - initState,  a named vector of initial state
# - data, the data set we are fitting the model to
# It should return the posterior for the given model, parameters,
# initial state and data.
my_dLogPosterior <- function(fitmodel, theta, initState, data) {

    logPrior <- # INSERT HERE: calculate the fitmodel log-prior
        # of `theta` using `fitmodel$dPrior`, and assign
        # to variable `logPrior`

    logLikelihood <- # INSERT HERE: calculate the log-likelihood of `theta`
        # and `initState` with respect to the data using `dTrajObs`
        # and assign to a variable `logLikelihood`

    logPosterior <- # INSERT HERE: calulate the log-posterior using the
        # log-prior and log-likelihood

    return(logPosterior)

}

```
