title: "Partial example: The Metropolis-Hastings sampler"
---

Below, you can find an example of how to code a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. Some bits are left out for you to fill in (marked "INSERT HERE"). Each "INSERT HERE" statement requires one line of code. If you struggle, you can find a link to a solution below the function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# This is a function that takes four parameters:
# - target: the target distribution, a function that takes one
#   argument (a number) and returns the (logged) value of a
#   distribution
# - initTheta: the initial value of theta, a number
# - proposalSd: the standard deviation of (Gaussian) proposal
#   distribution
# - nIterations: the number of iterations
# The function returns a vector of samples of theta from the target
# distribution
my_mcmcMh <- function(target, initTheta, proposalSd, nIterations) {
  # evaluate the function "target" at "initTheta", and assign to
  # a variable called targetThetaCurrent.
  targetThetaCurrent <- target(initTheta)

  # initialise variables to store the current value of theta, the
  # vector of samples, and the number of accepted proposals
  thetaCurrent <- initTheta
  samples <- initTheta
  accepted <- 0

  # run MCMC for nIteration interations
  for (i in seq_len(nIterations)) {
    thetaProposed <- # INSERT HERE: draw a new theta from the
      # (Gaussian) proposal distribution and assign to a
      # variable called "thetaProposed". See "?rnorm for help.

      targetThetaProposed <- # INSERT HERE: evaluate the function
      # target at the proposed theta and assign to a
      # variable called "targetThetaProposed"

      logAcceptance <- # INSERT HERE: compute Metropolis-Hastings ratio
      # (acceptance probability). This is easiest if you assume
      # the target function to return the logarithm of the
      # distribution value. Assign the result to a variable
      # called "logAcceptance"

      r <- # INSERT HERE: draw random number number between 0 and 1
      # using "runif" and assign to a variable called "r".

      # test acceptance by comparing the random number to the
      # Metropolis-Hastings ratio (acceptance probability) (using
      # "exp" because we calculated the logarithm of the
      # Metropolis-Hastings ratio before)
      if (r < exp(logAcceptance)) {
        # if accepted:
        thetaCurrent <- # INSERT HERE: change the current value
          # of theta to the proposed theta

          targetThetaCurrent <- # INSERT HERE: updated the current
          # value of the target

          # update number of accepted proposals
          accepted <- accepted + 1
      }

    # add the current theta to the vector of samples
    samples <- c(samples, thetaCurrent)

    # print current state of chain and acceptance rate
    cat(
      "chain:", thetaCurrent,
      "acceptance rate:", accepted / i, "\n"
    )
  }

  return(samples)
}
```

If you run into any problems, have a look at our [solution](mcmc_example_solution.html). Otherwise you can [return](mcmc.html#the-metropolis-hastings-sampler) to the practical.
