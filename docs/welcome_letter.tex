\opening{Dear participant,}
Thanks for registering to our short course on ``Model fitting and
inference for infectious disease dynamics'', 2--5 July at the London
School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). A few notes ahead of
the course:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Remember that you are expected to bring your own laptop. Please make sure
  you have a recent version of R installed
(at least 3.2.0). If any of that is a problem, let us know 
and we will come up with a solution. We will also have some replacement laptops
available, in case something breaks during the course.
\item An internet connection will be required for the course. The easiest
way for most of you is probably to connect through \emph{eduroam}. If you
don't have this set up on your laptop it might be worth checking how you
can get access. If you are not based at an academic institution or can't
get access to eduroam for another reason, we will set you up to connect
through LSHTM's own wireless network.
\item Attached is an introduction to some R commands and concepts
we will use during the course. If you don't use R in your daily work, it
would be useful to work through this ahead of the course. If you are a
regular R user, perhaps have a quick read to 
make sure you're familiar with the concepts.
\item Also attached is a rough timetable. We will start at 10am on Tuesday 2nd, and close at 3pm on Friday 5th. We will have a welcome lunch on the first day. Further lunches are not included in the course fee, but there are plenty of very goo and reasonably priced lunch options in and around the London School --- we will give you more information on this during the course.
\item We have booked a nearby restaurant for Wednesday, 3rd July, 7pm. We are hoping that as many as possible of you
can join --- if you already know that you won't be able to come to this,
please let us know to facilitate planning. The price of the dinner will
be covered by the course fee. There will be vegetarian options --- if you
have any other dietary requirements, please let us know as soon as
possible.
\item We are hoping for in interesting and stimulating course. If there are
any burning issues on your mind that you would like discussed, please
let us know and we'll try our best to accommodate your wishes.
\end{enumerate}
Any further questions, please do not hesitate to email at \href{mailto:sebastian.funk@lshtm.ac.uk}{sebastian.funk@lshtm.ac.uk}.

\closing{See you soon in London,}
\end{letter}
