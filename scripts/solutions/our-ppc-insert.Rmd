Below, you can find an example of how to code the posterior predictive checks. Some bits are left out for you to fill in (marked "INSERT HERE"). Each "INSERT HERE" statement requires one line of code. If you struggle, you can find a link to a solution below the function.

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk("our_ppc_insert.r")
```
```{r our_postPredCheck_insert}
```


If you run into any problems, have a look at our [solution](our_ppc.html), otherwise [return](mcmc_and_model_comparison.html#posterior-predictive-checks) to the pMCMC practical.
